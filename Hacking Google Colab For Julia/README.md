# What is this?
- This is a two notebook project that enables you to install Julia on colab and use it like Julia box or like the local juputer with julia kernel
- "Installing_Julia_and_checking_kernel.ipynb" Will install julia and display the version of available colab kernels, Julia Kernel should be displayed
- "Julia_Kernel.ipynb" This is your julia starting point.

# How did I made the above files
- I intsalled Julia from colab.
- I modified an normal ipynb notebook to use the julia kernel that was installed by a command in the first notebook, this notebook uses GPU but it can be modified using the same principle to use TPU, of course TPU support in julia should be installed, I modified the file using Nomal Text Editor (open it and you will see what I am talking about).
- For more info and How did I know this info in the first place see the Credits Section.
